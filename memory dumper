I see alot answers without explanation like someone 5lb for 1000 streams ? what kind servers ? 10gbps ? 20gpbs ?


Main server should be the strongest (with hardwares, CPU, RAM,) First because Xtream-ui is mounted in Ram its not installed on HDD
plus you have there mysql, crons.. and thats why its not good to stream and use panel on same server.

like someone told you , you should have min. 2 servers 1 main 1 LB ( Loadbalancer) LB should have ofcourse CPU & RAM good but most needed is bandwith because you streaming from LB and you need bandwith . most CPU and RAM takes channels that is DOWN because server (panel) non-stop trying to start stream + logs

if you have RAM issue and its not logical (mean you dont know why and should not be HIGH)

try this

nano /etc/sysctl.conf
search for vm.happiness if it does not exists


add the line at the bottom !

Code:
vm.happiness=100
( lower the value untill it fits your needings )

then
Bash:
sudo sysctl --load=/etc/sysctl.conf


Bash:
apt-get install libjemalloc1
service mysql restart

Step 1.
Bash:
nano /etc/mysql/my.cnf

Code:
malloc-lib=/usr/lib64/libjemalloc.so.1

step 2. (add line enviroment)

Bash:
nano /lib/systemd/system/mysql.service
Bash:
Environment=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libjemalloc.so.1

Step 3.
now just restart mysql service with:
Bash:
service mysql restart
